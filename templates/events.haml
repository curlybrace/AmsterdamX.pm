        :: Hold my beer and watch this!
      %p Perl has been described in many ways; a Shinto Shrine, executable line noise, a Swiss Army Chainsaw, the Duct Tape of the Internet, etc. But I think Perl is more like a old pop star, always reinventing itself to stay relevant, never truly leaving our consciousness, always just a melody away. What is the state of Perl today? Will Perl 6 be the big comeback? Will 2017 be the year we make Perl great again?

      %p Perl 5 is doing well in its latest stable version: 5.24. It will soon see it's newest version: 5.26. So why is 5.24 exciting, why will 5.26 be even more exciting, and what can we expect of future versions of Perl 5?
      %p This is my talk given at FOSDEM, for those who could not attend and would like to know what the status and the future of Perl 5 is.

      %p Luckily, Perlito Java Backend opens up the possibility of accessing native hadoop/hive/;hbase java APIs from Perl.

      %p Elixir is a nifty language built on top of the Erlang VM -- it pairs the Erlang superpowers (concurrency, reliability, distributed systems) with a Ruby-ish syntax and some revisions/reinterpretations of the Erlang standard library.
      %p We'll go through some of the strong and weak points, then build a simple application together.

      %p In this talk we brush through the rough edges of DBIx::Class and look how they can be alleviated with goodies like Candy, Helpers and other amazing add-ons for DBIx::Class.
      %p Also I will make a case why using DBIx::Class is a splendid idea, for example getting rid of embedded SQL, painless database upgrades and keeping the business logic outside of your main applications.

For perl circa 2004 Win32::Hardlink and Win32::Symlink came to CPAN but as junctions are not symlinks these are not a seamless replacement. Since Vista, Windows has had POSIX compliant symlinks. This talk will cover the development of Win32::Links to transparently support symlinks in Windows perl scripts.

No sweat!

Early in the Perl 6 design process Roles were added to the language and have since become an integral part of Perl 6. The idea of roles were also adopted by the Perl 5 community, which has many implementations of them, including Moose::Role, Moo::Role, Role::Tiny and more.
      %p In this talk, we will discuss some of the core concepts of roles and how they fit into and augment the normal OO design process. We will also spend some time looking at some of the well established patterns of Role usage, discussing the pros and cons of each approach.

      %p If serial killers would use these coding patterns as reasons for their killing sprees we would set them free of charge. Innocent men and women who could not be expected to remain silent in the face of such bothersome behavior.
      %p I will provide a (hopefully extensive) list of coding patterns I do not like to see, and will urge you to follow me into the righteous path of coding cleanly and understandably.
      %p This will also shield you as best as possible not to be hurt physically by me when working with me, which - by the end of the talk - you may not wish to do anyway.

        :: Pipeworks: Pipeline Processing Framework for Perl
      %p Presentation of a message oriented pipeline processing framework that allows separation of concerns and organization of functional units into small steps.
      %p The talk explains the concepts, ideas and how it is used in production to make typical cron jobs more testable, maintainable and extensible.

        :: An Introduction to Perlito5
      %p Perlito5 is the Perl5 compiler in the Perlito compiler collection.
      %p In this introduction we will discuss some applications of Perlito5, and then go through some of the internals.

        %li The Perlito project, Perl5 and Perl6 compilers
        %li Perl 5 to Javascript, running Perl in node.js and browser

        %li The Very Experimental Stuff - compile to XS, JIT
        %li Tour of the Perlito source code

        :: Forcing timeouts on sockets (PerlIO, Redis, Riak)
      %p When using a web service with high expectation on the speed and latency, you often want to abort connection if it's too slow / latency is too high.
      %p I present a portable way to automatically make a Perl socket aware of read / write timeouts. And I explain why I did that and how.

      %p PostgreSQL shares a lot of common threads with Perl. It's free, open source, extensible, and has a vibrant community.
      %p We'll compare and contrast Postgres to similar technologies. Then we'll delve into some seriously cool features you won't find in other RDBMS! We'll see how the PostgreSQL community derives inspiration from the Perl Community and how we can help!
